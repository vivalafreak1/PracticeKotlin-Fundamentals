# Movie Ticket Price

Movie tickets are typically priced differently based on the age of moviegoers.

In the initial code provided in the following code snippet, write a program that calculates these age-based ticket prices:

* A children's ticket price of $15 for people 12 years old or younger.
* A standard ticket price of $30 for people between 13 and 60 years old. On Mondays, discount the standard ticket price to $25 for this same age group.
* A senior ticket price of $20 for people 61 years old and older. Assume that the maximum age of a moviegoer is 100 years old.
* A -1 value to indicate that the price is invalid when a user inputs an age outside of the age specifications.
