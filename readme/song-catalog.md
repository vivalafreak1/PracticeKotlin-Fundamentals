# Song Catalog

Imagine that you need to create a music-player app.

Create a class that can represent the structure of a song. The Song class must include these code elements:

* Properties for the title, artist, year published, and play count
* A property that indicates whether the song is popular. If the play count is less than 1,000, consider it unpopular.
* A method that prints a song description in this format:

"[Title], performed by [artist], was released in [year published]."
