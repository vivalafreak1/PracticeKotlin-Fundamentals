# Mobile Notifications


Typically, your phone provides you with a summary of notifications.

In the initial code provided in the following code snippet, write a program that prints the summary message based on the number of notifications that you received. The message should include:

* The exact number of notifications when there are less than 100 notifications.
* 99+ as the number of notifications when there are 100 notifications or more.
