# Temperature Converter

There are three main temperature scales used in the world: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

In the initial code provided in the following code snippet, write a program that converts a temperature from one scale to another with these formulas:

* Celsius to Fahrenheit: 째 F = 9/5 (째 C) + 32
* Kelvin to Celsius: 째 C = K - 273.15
* Fahrenheit to Kelvin: K = 5/9 (째 F - 32) + 273.15

Note that the String.format("%.2f", /* measurement */ ) method is used to convert a number into a String type with 2 decimal places.
